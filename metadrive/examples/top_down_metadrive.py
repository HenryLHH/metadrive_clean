"""
This file illustrate how to use top-down renderer to provide observation in form of multiple channels of semantic maps.

We let the target vehicle moving forward directly. You can also try to control the vehicle by yourself. See the config
below for more information.

This script will popup a Pygame window, but that is not the form of the observation. We will also popup a matplotlib
window, which shows the details observation of the top-down pygame renderer.

The detailed implementation of the Pygame renderer is in TopDownMultiChannel Class (a subclass of Observation Class)
at: metadrive/obs/top_down_obs_multi_channel.py

We welcome contributions to propose a better representation of the top-down semantic observation!
