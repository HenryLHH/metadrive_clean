How to publish to pypi?  Noted by Zhenghao in Dec 27, 2020.

1. Remove old files and ext_modules from setup() to get a clean wheel for all platforms in py3-none-any.wheel
    rm -rf dist/ build/ documentation/build/ metadrive_simulator.egg-info/ docs/build/

2. Rename current version to X.Y.Z.rcA, where A is arbitrary value represent "release candidate A". 
   This is really important since pypi do not support renaming and re-uploading. 
   Rename version in metadrive/constants.py and setup.py 

3. Get wheel
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

    WARNING: when create wheels on windows, modifying MANIFEST.in to include assets by using
    recursive-include metadrive\\assets\\ *
    recursive-include metadrive\\examples\\ *

4. Upload to test channel
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

5. Test as next line. If failed, change the version name and repeat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ metadrive

6. Rename current version to X.Y.Z in setup.py, rerun 1, 3 steps.

7. Upload to production channel 
    twine upload dist/*
